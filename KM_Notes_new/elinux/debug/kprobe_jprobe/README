Kprobes, Jprobes, Return Probes
-------------------------------

Kprobes enables you to dynamically break into any kernel routine and collect debugging and performance information non-disruptively. You can trap at almost any kernel code address(*), specifying a handler
routine to be invoked when the breakpoint is hit.

 
A kprobe can be inserted on virtually any instruction in the kernel.
A jprobe is inserted at the entry to a kernel function, and provides convenient access to the function's arguments.  
A return probe fires when a specified function returns.
