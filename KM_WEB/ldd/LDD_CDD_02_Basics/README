Character Device Drivers Notes:


Charater Device File (Write followed by read not fetch data)
Regular File (Write followed by read than data available)


1. Application
     Based on the name of the device file  
2. Charater Device File (CDF)
     Based on the no.(major) of the device file
3. Charater Device Driver (CDD)
     Based on the h/w protocol
4. Charater Device (CD)

Major Number and Minor Numbers:
Major Number: Kernel uniquely identify each device by a number 
Minor Number: Minor number to distinguish b/w difference pieces of H/W.

2.4 kernel major (8 bit- 256), minor (8bit- 256)
2.6 kernel major (12 bit- 4K) ,minor (20 bit - 1M)



Device Files are created by the mknod command:
----------------------------------------------
mknod <name_device>  <device_type> <major> <minor> [-m modes]

	Example:
	mknod /dev/MyCharDevice c 253 15 -m 0666 

The below examples explain How to write a Character Device Driver.


LDD_CDD_01: This example explains function pointer basics and how to
	     initialize a function pointer in a structure.

LDD_CDD_02: This example shows how to write a Character Device Driver 
	    Template. It is also called as NULL driver /dev/null.

LDD_CDD_03: This example explains how to implement memory driver as 
	    character device driver and how to transfer data in between 
	    user space and kernel space. read, write implementation

LDD_CDD_04: This example shows how "register_char" function works.
	    All the above examples show, how to write a static character device driver.

LDD_CDD_05: This example explains how to write a dynamic character device driver.

LDD_CDD_06: This example explains how to write a Mulitple Character Device Driver.

LDD_CDD_07: This example shows how to create device file automatically.
