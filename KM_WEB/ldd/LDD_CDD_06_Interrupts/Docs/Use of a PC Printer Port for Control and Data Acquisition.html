</p><p><b>Abstract:</b> <i>A PC printer port is an inexpensive and yet powerful 
platform for implementing projects dealing with the control of real world 
peripherals.  The printer port provides eight TTL outputs, five inputs 
and four bidirectional leads and it provides a very simple means to use 
the PC interrupt structure.

This article discusses how to use program the printer port.  A larger 
manual which deals with such topics as driver circuits, optoisolators, 
control of DC and stepping motors, infrared and radio remote control, 
digital and analog multiplexing, D/A and A/D is avaialable.  See

<p></p><center><h3>A.  Port Assignments</h3></center>     
     
<p>Each printer port consists of three port addresses; data, status and control port.       
These       
addresses are in sequential order.  That is, if the data port is at address 0x0378, the       
corresponding status port is at 0x0379 and the control port is at 0x037a.      
      
</p><p>The following is typical.      
      
      
</p><p></p><pre><b> 
       Printer         Data Port        Status          Control</b>      
	LPT1            0x03bc          0x03bd          0x03be      
	LPT2            0x0378          0x0379          0x037a      
	LPT3            0x0278          0x0279          0x027a 
</pre>      
      
<p>My experience has been that machines are assigned a base address for LPT1 of either       
0x0378 or 0x03bc.      
      
</p><p>To definitively identify the assignments for a particular machine, use the DOS debug       
program to display memory locations 0040:0008.  For example:      
      
</p><p></p><pre>    
	&gt;debug      
	-d 0040:0008 L8      
	0040:0008       78 03 78 02 00 00 00 00    
</pre>      
      
<p>Note in the example that LPT1 is at 0x0378, LPT2 at 0x0278 and LPT3 and LPT4      
are not       
assigned.      
      
</p><p>Thus, for this hypothetical machine;      
      
</p><p></p><pre><b>    
       Printer         Data Port        Status          Control</b>      
	LPT1            0x0378          0x0379          0x037a      
	LPT2            0x0278          0x0279          0x027a      
	LPT3            NONE      
	LPT4            NONE    
</pre>      
      
<p>An alternate technique is to run Microsoft Diagnostics (MSD.EXE) and review the      
LPT       
assignments.      
      
</p><p></p><center><h3>B.  Outputs</h3></center>     
      
<p>Please refer to the figures titled Figure #1 - Pin Assignments and Figure #2 - Port       
Assignments.  These two figures illustrate the pin assignments on the 25 pin connector       
and the bit assignments on the three ports.

<p><b>Fig 2.  Port Assignments</b></p></center>    
<hr>    
<p>Note that there are eight outputs on the Data Port (Data 7(msb) - Data 0) and four       
additional outputs on the low nibble of the Control Port.  /SELECT_IN, INIT, /AUTO       
FEED and /STROBE.      
      
</p><p>[Note that with /SELECT_IN, the "in" refers to the printer.  For normal printer      
operation,       
the PC exerts a logic zero to indicate to the printer it is selected.  The original function of       
INIT was to initialize the printer, AUTO FEED to advance the paper.  In normal printing,       
STROBE is high.  The character to be printed is output on the Data Port and STROBE is       
momentarily brought low.]      
      
</p><p>All outputs on the Data Port are true logic.  That is, writing a logic one to a bit causes      
the       
corresponding output to go high.  However, the /SELECT_IN, /AUTOFEED and       
/STROBE outputs on the Control Port have inverted logic.  That is, outputting a logic one       
to a bit causes a logic zero on the corresponding output.  This adds some complexity in       
using the printer port, but the fix is to simply invert those bits using the exclusive OR       
function prior to outputting.      
      
</p><p>[One might ask why the designers of the printer port designed the port in this manner.        
Assume you have a printer with no cable attached.  An open usually is read as a logic one.        
Thus, if a logic one on the SELECT_IN, AUTOFEED and STROBE leads meant to take       
the appropriate action, an unconnected printer would assume it was selected, go into the       
autofeed mode and assume there was data on the outputs associated with the Data Port.        
The printer would be going crazy when in fact it wasn't even connected.  Thus, the       
designers used inverted logic.  A zero forces the appropriate action.]      
      
</p><p>Returning to the discussion of the Control Port, assume you have a value val1 which      
is to       
be output on the Data port and a value val2 on the Control port:      
      
</p><pre>    
	#define DATA 0x03bc      
	#define STATUS DATA+1      
	#define CONTROL DATA+2      
	...      
	int val1, val2;      
	...      
	val1 = 0x81;    /* 1000 0001 */         /* Data bits 7 and 0 at one */      
	   outportb(DATA, val1);      
	val2 = 0x08;    /* 0000 1000 */      
	   outportb(CONTROL, VAL2^0x0b);      
	/* SELECT_IN = 1, INIT = 0, /AUTO_FEED = 0, /STROBE = 0 */    
</pre>      
      
<p>Note that only the lower nibble of val2 is significant.  Note that in the last line of code,       
/SELECT_IN, /AUTO_FEED and /STROBE are output in inverted form by using the       
exclusive-or function so as to compensate for the hardware inversion.      
      
</p><p>For example; if I intended to output 1 0 0 0 on the lower nibble and did not do the       
inversion, the hardware would invert bit 3, leave bit 2 as true and invert bits 1 and 0.  The       
result, appearing on the output would then be 0 0 1 1 which is about as far from what was       
desired as one could get.  By using the exclusive-or function, 1 0 0 0 is actually sent to the       
port as 0 0 1 1.  The hardware then inverts bits 3, 1 and 0 and the output is then the       
desired 1 0 0 0.      
      
</p><p></p><center><h3>C.  Inputs</h3></center>     
      
<p>Note that in the diagram showing the Status Port there are five status leads from the      
printer.  (BSY, /ACK, PE (paper empty), SELECT, /ERROR).      
      
</p><p>[The original intent in the naming of most of these is intuitive.  A high on SELECT      
indicates the printer is on line.  A high on BSY or PE indicates to the PC that the printer is      
busy or out of paper.  A low wink on /ACK indicates the printer received something.  A      
low on ERROR indicates the printer is in an error condition.]     
      
</p><p>These inputs are fetched by reading the five most significant bits of the status port.      
      
</p><p>However, the original designers of the printer interface circuitry, inverted the bit      
associated with the BSY using hardware.  That is, when a zero is present on input BSY,      
the bit will actually be read as a logic one.  Normally, you will want to use "true" logic,    
and      
thus you will want to invert this bit.      
      
</p><p>The following fragment illustrates the reading the five most significant bits in "true"      
logic.      
      
</p><pre>    
	#define DATA 0x03bc      
	#define STATUS DATA+1      
	...      
	unsigned int in_val;      
	...      
	in_val = ((inportb(STATUS)^0x80) &gt;&gt; 3);    
</pre>     
      
<p>Note that the Status Port is read and the most significant bit, corresponding to the      
BSY      
lead is inverted using the exclusive-or function.  The result is then shifted such that the      
upper five bits are in the lower five bit positions.      
      
</p><pre>    
	0 0 0 BUSY /ACK PE SELECT /ERROR     
</pre>     
      
<p>Another input, IRQ on the Status Port is not brought to a terminal on the DB-25      
printer      
port connector.  I have yet to figure out how to use this bit.      
      
</p><p>At this point, you should see that, at a minimum, there are 12 outputs; eight on the      
Data      
Port and four on the lower nibble of the Control Port.  There are five inputs, on the      
highest five bits of the Status Port.  Three output bits on the Control Port and one input      
on the Status Port are inverted by the hardware, but this is easily handled by using the      
exclusive-or function to selectively invert bits.      
      
</p><p></p><center><h3>D.  Simple Example</h3></center>     
     
<p>Refer to the figure titled Figure #3 - Typical Application showing a normally open     
push      
button switch being read on the BUSY input (Status Port, Bit 7) and an LED which is      
controlled by Bit 0 on the Data Port.  A C language program which causes the LED to      
flash when the push-button is depressed appears below.  Note that an output logic zero      
causes the LED to light.

<p></p><center><h3>F.  Interrupts</h3></center>     
     
<p>Again refer to Figure #2-Port assignments.  Note that bit 4 on the Control Bit is     
identified      
as IRQ Enable.  Normally, this bit is set to zero.     
     
</p><p>However, there are times when interrupts are of great value.  An interrupt is nothing     
more      
than a hardware event which causes your program to momentarily stop what it is doing,      
and jump to a function to do what you desire.  When this is complete, your program      
returns to where it left off.     
     
</p><p>In using the printer port, if the IRQ Enable is set to a logic one, an interrupt occurs     
when      
input ACK next goes from a logic one to logic zero.  For example, you might use input      
ACK for an intrusion alarm.  You might have a program running which is continually      
monitoring temperature.  But, when input ACK goes low, it interrupts your temperature      
monitoring and goes to some other code you have written to handle an alarm.  Perhaps, to      
fetch the time and date off the system clock and write this to an Intrusion File.  When      
done, your program continues monitoring temperature.     
     
</p><p>Interrupts are treated in detail elsewhere in this manual.     
     
</p><p></p><center><h3>G.  Changing Only Selected Bits</h3></center>     
     
<p>Frequently, when outputting, the programmer is interested in only a portion of a byte     
and      
it is a burden to remember what all the other bits are.  Please review the following where      
bit 2 is brought high for 100ms and then brought low.     
     
</p><pre>     
	int data;     
	...     
	data=data | 0x04;/* bring bit 2 high */     
	outportb(DATA,data);     
	delay(100);     
	data=data &amp; 0xfb; /* bring bit 2 low */     
	outportb(DATA,data);     
</pre>     
    
<p>Note that variable data keeps track of the current state on the output port.  Each bit      
manipulation is performed on data and variable data is then output.     
     
</p><p>To bring a specific bit to a logic one, use the OR function to OR that bit with a logic     
one      
(and all others with a logic zero.)     
     
</p><p>To bring a specific bit to a logic zero, AND that bit with a zero (and all others with a     
logic      
one.)     
Calculating this value can be tedious.  Consider this alternative:     
     
</p><pre>     
	data=data &amp; 0xfb;       /* hard to calculate */     
	data=data &amp; (~0x04);    /* the same but a lot easier */     
</pre>     
     
<p>This really isn't very difficult.  Assume, you currently have; XXXX XXXX and desire      
XX01 X100.     
     
</p><pre>     
	data=data &amp; (~0x20) | 0x10 | 0x04 &amp; (~0x02) &amp; (~0x01);     
</pre>     
    
<p></p><center><h3>H.  Ports on Newer PC's</h3></center>     
     
<p>A few words about the DIRECTION bit on the Control Port.  I have seen PC's where     
this      
bit may be set to a logic "one" which turns around the Data Port such that all of the Data      
leads are inputs.  I have also seen PC's where this worked for only the lower nibble of the      
Data Port and other PC's where it did nothing.  It is probably best not to use this feature.       
Rather, leave the DIRECTION bit set to logic "zero".     
     
</p><p></p><center><h3>I.  Differences In Printer Ports</h3></center>     
     
<p>The material discussed above is believed to be pretty generic; that is, common to all      
manufacturers.     
     
</p><p>You may well ask, "why would they be different.  After all, programs such as     
WordPerfect      
must work on all machines."  The answer is that the programmers who write such      
programs as WordPerfect do not get down to this low level of hardware detail.  Rather,      
they write to interface with the PC's BIOS.     
     
</p><p>The BIOS (Basic Input-Output System) is a ROM built in to the PC which makes all     
PC's      
appear the same.  This is a pretty nice way for each vendor to implement their design with      
a degree of flexibility.     
     
</p><p>An example is the port assignments discussed above.  This data is read from the BIOS      
ROM when your PC boots up and written to memory locations beginning at 0040:0008.       
Thus, the designers of WordPerfect don't worry about the port assignments.  Rather, they      
read the appropriate memory location.     
     
</p><p>In the same way, they interface with the BIOS for printing.  For example, if the     
designers      
want to print a character, the AH register is set to zero, the character to be printed is      
loaded into AL, the port (LPT1, LPT2, etc) is loaded into the DX register.  They then      
execute a BIOS INT 17h.  Program control is then passed to the BIOS and which      
performs at the low level of hardware design which we are trying to work.  The BIOS      
varies from one hardware design to another; it's purpose is to work with the hardware.  If      
inversions are necessary, it is done in the BIOS.  When the BIOS has completed whatever      
bit sequencing is required to write the character to the printer, control is passed back to      
the program with status information in the AH register.     
     
</p><p></p><center><h3>J.  Summary</h3></center>     
     
<p>In summary, the printer port affords a very simple technique for interfacing with     
external      
circuitry.  Twelve output bits are available, eight on the Data Port and four on the lower      
nibble of the Control Port.  Inversions are necessary on three of the bits on the Control      
Port.  Five inputs are available on the Status Port.  One software inversion is necessary      
when reading these bits.

<p></p><center><h2>II.  Forcing an Interrupt on the Printer Port.</h2></center>     
  
<p></p><center><h3>A.  Introduction</h3></center>  
  
<p>This section describes how to use hardware interrupts using the printer port.  The   
discussion closely follows programs prnt_int.c and time_int.c  
  
</p><p>A hardware interrupt is a capability where a hardware event causes the software to  
stop   
whatever it is doing and to be redirected to a function to handle the interrupt.  When done,   
the program picks up where it left off.  Aside from loosing time in executing the interrupt   
service routine, the operation of the main program remains unaffected by the interrupt.  
  
</p><p>This is quite powerful and although at first, the whole process may appear difficult to   
grasp, it is in fact quite simple.  
  
</p><p>Although this discussion focuses on using the interrupt associated with the printer  
port,   
the same technique may be adapted to exerting interrupts directly on the ISA bus.  
  
</p><p></p><center><h3>B.  Interrupt Handler Table</h3></center>  
  
<p>When an interrupt occurs, the PC must know where to go to handle the interrupt.  
  
</p><p>The original 8088 PC design provided for up to 256 interrupts (0x00 - 0xff).  This   
includes both hardware and software interrupts.  Each of these 256 interrupt types has   
four bytes in a table beginning at memory location 0x00000.  Thus, INT 0 uses memory   
locations 0x00000, 0x00001, 0x00002, 0x00003, INT 1 uses the next four bytes in the   
table, etc.  Note that INT 8 then uses the four bytes at 0x0020, INT 9 begins at 0x0024,   
etc.  This 1024 bytes (256x4) is termed the interrupt vector table.  
  
</p><p>These four bytes contain the address of where the PC is to go to when an interrupt  
occurs.    
Most of the table is loaded when you boot up the machine.  The table may be added to or   
entries modified when you run various applications.  
  
</p><p>IBM reserved eight hardware interrupts beginning at INT 0x08 for interrupt  
expansion.    
These are commonly known as IRQ0 - IRQ7, the IRQ corresponding to the lead   
designations associated with the Intel 8259 which was used to control these interrupts.    
Thus, IRQ 0 corresponds to INT 8, IRQ 1 corresponds to INT 9, etc.  
  
</p><p>Exercise.  Use debug to examine the interrupt vector table which is assigned to IRQ 0   
through IRQ 7.  
  
</p><pre>  
-d 00000:0020 20  
  
	B3 10 3B 0B 73 2C 3B 0B-57 00 70 03 8B 3B 3B 0B  
	ED 3B 3B 0B AC 3A 3B 0B-B7 00 70 03 F4 06 70 00  
  
</pre>  
(Recall that the table allocation for INT 8 begins at 0x0020).  
  
<p>From this I can see that the address for the interrupt service routine associated with  
IRQ 0   
is 0B3B:10B3.  For IRQ 7, 0070:06F4.  You should be able to see the algorithm I used to   
obtain this.  
  
</p><p>Thus, when an IRQ 7 interrupt occurs, we know this corresponds to INT 0x0f and the   
address of the interrupt service routine is located at 0070:06F4.  
  
</p><p>Exercise.  Use the debugger to examine the interrupt vector table.  Then use  
Microsoft   
Diagnostics (MSD) and examine the IRQ addresses and compare the two.  
  
</p><p></p><center><h3>C.  Modifying the Interrupt Handler Table</h3></center>  
  
<p>Assume, you are going to use IRQ 7.  Assume that when an IRQ 7 interrupt occurs,  
you   
desire your program to proceed to function irq7_int_serv, a function which you wrote.  In   
order to do so, you must first modify the interrupt handler table.  Of course, you may wish   
to carefully take what is already there in the table and save it somewhere and then when   
you leave your program, put the old value back.  
  
</p><p>Borland's Turbo C provides functions to do this.  
  
</p><pre>  
  
	int intlev=0x0f;  
  
	oldfunc = getvect (intlev);  
		/* The content of 0x0f is fetched and saved for future  
		**use. */  
  
	setvect (intlev, irq7_int_serv);  
		/* New address is placed in table. */  
		/* irq7_int_serv is the name of routine and is of type  
		** interrupt far*/  
</pre>  
  
<p>This may look bad, but, in fact it isn't.  Simply get the vector now associated with  
INT   
0x0f and save it in a variable named oldfunc.  Then set the entry associated with INT 0x0f   
to be the address of your interrupt service routine.  
  
</p><p>Good programming dictates that once you are done with your program, you would  
restore   
the entry to what it was;  
  
</p><pre>  
	setvect(intlev, oldfunc);  
</pre>  
  
<p>After all, what would you think of WordPerfect, if after running it, you couldn't use  
your   
modem without rebooting.  
  
</p><p></p><center><h3>D.  Masking</h3></center>  
  
<p>The programmer can mask interrupts.  If an interrupt is masked you are saying  to the  
PC,   
"for the moment ignore any IRQ 7 type interrupts".  Normally, we don't do this.  Rather   
we desire to set the interrupt mask such that IRQ 7 is enabled.  
  
</p><p>Port 0x21 is associated with the interrupt mask.  To enable a particular IRQ, write a  
zero   
to that bit location.  However, you don't want to disturb any of the other bits.  
  
</p><pre>  
	mask=inportb(0x21) &amp; ~0x80;  
		/* Get current mask.  Set bit 7 to 0.  Leave other bits  
		** undisturbed. */  
	outportb(0x21, mask);  
</pre>  
  
<p>The user is now ready for IRQ 7 interrupts.  Note that each time there is an IRQ 7   
interrupt, the program is unconditionally redirected to the function irq7_int_serv.  The   
user is free to do whatever they like but must tell the PC that the interrupt has been   
processed;  
  
</p><pre>  
	outportb(0x20, 0x20);  
</pre>  
  
<p>Prior to exiting the program, the user should return the system to its original state;  
setting   
bit 7 of the interrupt mask to logic one and restoring the interrupt vector.  
  
</p><pre>  
	mask=inportb(0x21) | 0x80;  
	outportb(0x21, mask);  
  
	setvect(intlev, oldfunc);  
</pre>  
  
<p></p><center><h3>E.  Interrupt Service Routine</h3></center>  
  
<p>In theory, you should be able to do anything in your interrupt service routine (ISR).   
For   
example, an interrupt might be forced by external hardware detecting an intrusion.  The   
ISR might fetch the time off the system clock, open a file and write the time and other   
information to the file, close the file and then return to the main program.  
  
</p><p>In fact, I have not had good luck in doing this and you will note that my interrupt  
service   
routines are limited;  
  
</p><ul>  
<li>disable any further interrupts.  
</li><li>set a variable such that in returning to the main program there is an indication that an   
interrupt occurred.  
</li><li>indicate to the PC that the interrupt was processed; outportb(0x20,0x20);  
</li><li>enable interrupts.  
</li></ul>  
  
<p>I think that my problem is that interrupts are turned off during the entire ISR which  
may   
well preclude a C function which may use interrupts.  For example, in opening a file, I   
assume interrupts are used by Turbo C to interface with the disk drive.  Unlike the IRQ   
we are discussing, the actual implementation of how C handles these interrupts necessary   
to implement a C function will not be "heard" by the PC and the program will appear to   
bomb.  
  
</p><p>My suggestion is that you initially use the technique I have used in writing your  
interrupt   
service routine.  That is, very simple; either setting or incrementing a variable.  However,   
recognize that this is barely scratching the surface.  
  
</p><p>Then you might try a more complex ISR of the following form.  At the time of this  
writing   
I have not tried this.  
  
</p><ul>  
<li>disable all interrupts.  
</li><li>set mask to disable IRQ 7 interrupts.  
</li><li>outportb(0x20,0x20).  
</li><li>enable all interrupts.  
  
</li><li>.. do whatever needs to be done ..  
  
</li><li>disable all interrupts.
</li><li>set mask to enable IRQ 7 interrupts.  
</li><li>enable interrupts.  
</li></ul> 
  
<p>Note the difference from the previous.  Any further IRQ 7 interrupts are blocked  
while in   
the ISR, but in the middle of the ISR, all other interrupts are enabled.  This should permit   
all C functions to work.  
  
</p><p></p><center><h3>F.  IRQ Enable Bit</h3></center>  
  
<p>Recall that there are three ports associated with the control of a printer port; Data,  
Status   
and Control.  Bit 4 of the Control Port is a PC output; IRQ Enable.  Note that Bit 2 of the   
Status Port is a PC input; /IRQ.  Neither of these bits are associated with the DB-25   
connector.  Rather, they control logic on the printer card or PC motherboard.  
  
</p><p>If the IRQ Enable output is at logic one, an interrupt occurs on a negative going  
transition   
on the /ACK input.  (I have yet to figure out what the IRQ input does).  
  
</p><p>Thus, in addition to setting the mask to entertain interrupts from IRQ 7 as discussed   
above, you must also set IRQ Enable to a logic one.  
  
</p><pre>  
	mask=inportb(0x21) &amp; ~0x80;  
	outportb(0x21,mask);  /* as discussed above */  
  
	outportb(CONTROL, inportb(CONTROL) | 0x10);  
</pre>  
  
<p>Note that in this implementation, all bits other than Bit 4 on the Control Port are left  
as   
they were.  
  
</p><p>Prior to exiting from your program, it is good practice to leave things tidy.  That is,  
set Bit   
4 back to a zero.  
  
</p><pre>  
	outportb(CONTROL, inportb(CONTROL) &amp; ~0x10);  
</pre>

<hr> 
<p></p><center><h3>G.  Programs</h3></center>  
<p>Program PRNT_INT.C simply causes a screen message to indicate an interrupt has   
occurred.  Note that global variable "int_occurred" is set to false in the declaration.  On   
interrupt, this is set to true.  Thus, the code in main within the if(int_occurred) is only   
executed if a hardware interrupt did indeed occur.  
  
</p><p>Program TIME_INT.C is the same except for main.  When the first interrupt occurs,  
the   
time is fetched off the system clock.  Otherwise the new time is fetched and the difference   
is calculated and displayed.
