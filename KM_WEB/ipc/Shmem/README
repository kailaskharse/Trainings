shared memory arrange for the memory being shared between different processes to be the same physical
memory.



1. Allocate segment ---- shmget()

When we first create a shared memory segment, itâ€™s not accessible by any process. To enable access to the
shared memory, we must attach it to the address space of a process. 

2. Attach Segment    ----shmat()

3. Detach segment   -----shmdt()



shmat(seg_id,pointer to address space , flag)

shmget(common,1024,create no of bytes)


This is done by Admin login only.
